# Re-Uni

Re-Uni is a marketplace oriented towards buying, selling, and trading used university-related materials and apparel. 

University is expensive. Much of what we, as students, buy during our time in university is used only a handful of times.
Let's cut down on spending and waste-production by encouraging second-hand buying of univerity supplies and merch!
